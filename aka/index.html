           <br>
           Travelling and tourism is good for a multitude of reasons, for example:</p> 
      <ol class="travel-benefits">
        <li>International travel allows you to experience a vast array of cultures, traditions, and histories.</li>
        <li>Traveling abroad can also have a positive impact on your mental health. It can help you reduce stress and anxiety and also can offer a sense of adventure.</li>
        <li>Seeing the world provides an education that's absolutely impossible to get in school.</li>
        <li>Travelling can help you become more independent and gain leadership qualities, especially if you're travelling alone.</li>
        <li>Tourism increases economic activity. The influx of tourists drives up local businesses' demand for services and products, creating jobs, increasing revenue, and reducing poverty.</li>
    </ol>
