      <h2>How has the roll out of fibre broadband affected the average speed for customers in Ireland?</h2>
      <br>
      
      <!-- Paragraph explaining the purpose of the page -->
      <p style="text-align: center">Today I hope to answer that question. In the navigation bar, you will see 2 links to graphs. These 2 graphs are made from Plotly based on data I publicly accessed from ComReg.</p>
      <br>
      
      <!-- Explanation of trends observed in the graphs -->
      <p style="text-align: center">As we can see from the graphs, as the number of fibre broadband connections goes up, the average connection speed for customers also goes up. From this, we can conclude that the roll-out of fibre has positively affected network speeds across Ireland.</p>
      <br>
      
      <!-- Acknowledgment of data limitations -->
      <p style="text-align: center">While this data doesn't span over a long period of time, it still reflects the impact that fibre broadband is having on Ireland. I did try to span from 2019 to 2024, but some of the columns were blank for the data I needed.</p>
